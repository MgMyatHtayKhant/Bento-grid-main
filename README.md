## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

This is my 8th project and also I built with grid again. This project is a little more difficult than previous projects.

### What I learned

I learned more about grid template area property. It's very handy to build this project.

```css
.containers {
  max-width: 1000px;
  margin: 4rem auto;
  grid-template-areas:
    "seven one one four"
    "seven two three four"
    "eight two three four"
    "eight six five five";
}
```
